# Blog Post Images

## Missing Blog Images
Place your actual blog post images in this directory:

- `autonomy-stack.avif` - Autonomy stack article featured image
- `battery-monitoring.avif` - Battery monitoring article featured image
- `sensor-fusion-libraries.avif` - Sensor fusion libraries article featured image

## Recommended Specifications
- Format: AVIF (preferred) or WebP/JPEG
- Size: 1200x630px (ideal for social sharing)
- Max file size: 500KB
- Optimization: Use Sharp or Squoosh.app

## Alternative Sources
You can use placeholder images from:
- Unsplash: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/technology
- Pexels: https://www.pexels.com/search/tech/
- Lorem Picsum: https://picsum.photos/1200/630

## Quick Fix
Until you have actual images, the site will show a gray placeholder.
The site is fully functional without these images.
