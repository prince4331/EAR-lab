# Image Placeholders

## Missing Project Images
Place your actual project images in this directory:

- `warehouse-robot.avif` - Warehouse robotics project image
- `battery-management.avif` - Battery management system image
- `sensor-fusion.avif` - Sensor fusion project image

## Recommended Specifications
- Format: AVIF (preferred) or WebP/JPEG
- Size: 1200x675px (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Max file size: 500KB
- Optimization: Use Sharp or Squoosh.app

## Alternative Sources
You can use placeholder images from:
- Unsplash: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/robotics
- Pexels: https://www.pexels.com/search/robot/
- Lorem Picsum: https://picsum.photos/1200/675

## Quick Fix
Until you have actual images, the site will show a gray placeholder.
The site is fully functional without these images.
